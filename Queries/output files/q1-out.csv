Rather than understanding negotiations as an opportunity to defeat an adversary, they work as a team together with their counterparts, to increase the value of the outcome for every stakeholder. They persuade, but within a framework of truthfulness, respect, and social responsibility, because their goal is not a short-term personal victory, but a long-term fruitful relationship that benefits everyone.
In this workshop, we will emphasize the importance of continuously improving our negotiation skills, regardless of our area of expertise. Also, we will introduce the principled negotiations model, increase our ability to identify opportunities for negotiation, and become more persuasive negotiators. Finally, the workshop will offer an opportunity to apply these concepts in practical simulations.

It stimulates questioning techniques, dialogue, choices and involves a variety of strategies designed to promote greater overall student engagement. But what happens to student engagement when it comes to assessment? A central component and a real challenge faculty face when implementing active learning is how to make learner assessments equally active so that students experience continuity. In this workshop we will look at practical strategies that can help faculty develop assessments that promote deeper learning with a particular emphasis on collaborative exams (two-stage exams). A portion of the workshop will be spent working collaboratively on the planning and design of assessments for active learning. Participants are encouraged to bring along an existing assessment to work on as part of the re-envisioning process.

Research proposals vary tremendously between departments, research areas, and individuals, but there are also standard ways to present this material for each agency and scholarship program. Most fundamentally, this requires that all applicants read the program instructions carefully for the drafts they are creating.  For example, several programs require clear 1) background/introduction, 2) hypothesis/aims/objectives, 3) method/description, 4) Implications/Impact. This can often mean creating sub-headings within your proposal to explicitly identify and address each of these elements.

Note: Students are still ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they ultimately select. 
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: 
•	Identify the key elements that are required within a research proposal, for a certain funding program under NSERC/FRQNT or CIHR/FRQS.
•	Format your proposal in such a way to highlight each of these essential items.
•	Draft a preliminary research proposal and send it out for appropriate peer-review and feedback.

This workshop is led by Michael Verwey, the Fellowship Development Advisor in the School of Graduate Studies at Concordia University. After completing his doctorate in the Department of Psychology at Concordia University, Michael was a postdoctoral researcher at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute and the Montreal Clinical Research Institute. In support of these research experiences, Michael has held several competitive scholarships and fellowships, from the FRQS, CIHR, NSERC, and Concordia University.

Burnout. It’s not just a buzzword. In fact, for 35% of all Canadian workers, it’s a painful reality. One that’s only been exacerbated by the pandemic. Thankfully, there are steps that can be taken to foster a healthier work environment and prevent burnout before it occurs. And this workshop with neuro-psychologist Julie Hanck can help you learn how to do both. From identifying the causes of burnout to implementing healthier workplace practices, you’ll deepen your understanding of this devastating modern phenomenon to help make a positive difference in your organization. 
*CNT*
This workshop will empower you to:
• Understand burnout and identify it in your employees’/team members’ behaviours;
• Learn how to prevent burnout in your workplace;
• Build a sense of community to help reinforce resilience and engagement within your team;    
• Communicate more effectively with individuals who are experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety;  
• Familiarize yourself with available resources and become comfortable normalizing their use.  
*APP*
In this workshop, activities, group discussions and surveys will be incorporated to keep you active and engaged. To help maximize learning, we highly recommended you keep your camera on throughout the workshop.
*WHO*
• Business owners, team leaders, managers, HR professionals and others who want to better understand burnout so they can help prevent it in their workplace.
• Employees and anyone else who want a greater understanding of what causes burnout and how to prevent it.

*KEYB*
Today, data is a powerful asset for any organization. Data is literally everywhere and it is growing exponentially: 500 million tweets or 294 billion emails per day, 65 billion messages on WhatsApp, etc. This high volume, combined with the variety of sources (i.e., structured, unstructured, etc.) and the velocity or pace of the data generation brings multiple opportunities for value creation. You won’t be surprised to learn it also brings about some challenges such as data collection, storage, analysis and most importantly, integration.

A properly designed data integration process is THE key step to combine different data sources by adapting their format, fields and the way they are consumed. For this to happen, ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) tools are a simple and scalable solution. During this workshop, expert Adrian Gonzalez-Sanchez will provide you with a proper understanding of the data-driven value creation process, the main data integration techniques and tools, and how to design a solid and scalable ETL workflow. Intrigued? We’d be surprised if you weren’t.
*CNT*
This training will enable you to:
•	Understand the different types of data and their potential value;
•	Explore data integration techniques and choose those that are the best fit for your data sources;
•	Explain traditional issues and challenges of data exploration, and the role of the ETL tools to solve them;
•	Present the most important ETL tools, their subscription models and advantages.
*APP*
This business-oriented workshop is based on fundamental theories and industry case studies taken from large data-driven companies. In short, you’ll learn by reading, thinking and doing. Case readings and AV material are drawn from current topics and recent news/events.

*KEYB*
Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals to be aware of international legal regulations, ethical aspects of AI, and data privacy associated with both public and private, current and future data-related initiatives. 
*CNT*
This training will enable you to:
•	Analyze international data protection laws in the US, Canada, Europe and China;
•	Evaluate and analyze the role of ethical and legal implications associated with the boom of international AI initiatives and the development of ethical principles in AI;
•	Understand the importance of evaluating ethical and legal impact as a result of AI technologies when developing an AI-oriented business strategy;
•	Discuss existing industry cases such as Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, Amazon, etc.
*APP*
This business-oriented workshop is based on fundamental theories and industry case studies taken from large data-driven companies. In short, you’ll learn by reading, analyzing, and discussing. Case readings and AV material are drawn from current topics and recent news/events.
In order to maximize engagement and knowledge transfer during our online workshops, it is highly recommended that participants keep their cameras on.

Drawing on the insights offered by the interdisciplinary field of memory studies, it explores the interactions between past and present and memory and forgetting by tracing the ways key historical events have been historicized, revised, commemorated, and otherwise remembered (and silenced) over time by nationalists, unionists, ‘exiles’, and other ‘communities of memory’ in Ireland and among the Irish Diaspora. Possible memory case studies include the 1641 Rebellion; the Williamite War; the 1798 Rising; the Great Famine; the First World War and the events of the Irish Revolution; the Northern Irish ‘Troubles”; and Church-State institutional abuse in independent Ireland.

"http://focu.io/data#course_ENGL_340","Modernism","6.0","ENGL","340","""The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the """"Jazz Age,"""" the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).""

The basic goals of peer instruction are to encourage and make use of student interaction during lectures, while focusing students' attention on underlying concepts and techniques. The method has been assessed in many studies using standardized, diagnostic tests and shown to be considerably more effective than the conventional lecture approach to teaching. Peer instruction is now used in a wide range of courses. In this workshop, participants will learn about peer instruction, serve as the &quot;class&quot; in which peer instruction is demonstrated, discuss several models for implementing the technique into the classroom, and learn about available teaching resources. While successfully implementing peer instruction doesn't require any technology, using the right technology can improve student engagement, increase learning, and make it easier to implement peer instruction in your classroom.
~~~
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to 
1. Articulate challenges in engaging students in lecture-based classes
2. Explain how Peer Instruction can be used to address identified challenges with student engagement 
3. Reflect on the relationship between technology and pedagogy in the service of student learning 
4. Think differently and holistically about what makes good teaching and learning

In this class, we will focus on applications to the major federal and provincial agencies providing scholarships in research sectors related to the social sciences, humanities, and arts (SSHRC & FRQSC). A brief overview of general strategies and tips regarding the research proposals, will be followed by breakout groups where students will discuss and brainstorm their emerging proposals.

In addition to having an outline of their own proposed research prepared before class, students will also be entrusted with the chance to discuss the work of others.  Some of this will be done within the workshop setting, while some amount of “homework” will likely be exchanged by email in the days following this meeting. This exchange of feedback (peer-review) between students is expected to unfold in a respectful, confidential, and constructive way.

***Notes: Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out on by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they select. Peer-review can be an excellent source of constructive criticism, but it is the responsibility of the individual author to decide which feedback to use.***

1.	Common strategies when drafting a competitive research proposal;
2.	How to provide and receive courteous and constructive peer-review;
3.	A small group of least 2-3 other students, with whom peer-review can be exchanged.

Articulate and communicate your skills","2.0","GPSC","464","This training is to support students to reflect on their experiences outside the classroom, and be better able to articulate their own learning and skills development to their peers, their teachers, and potential employers or graduate schools.

If you have participated in learning experiences outside the classroom (ex: workshops, internships, competitions, research, student leadership, performance, study abroad, etc) but aren’t sure how to express the skills you have gained, then this workshop is for you.  

This is an interactive workshop that includes individual and group work, role-play/practice and immediate feedback. The learning and skills developed during the workshop will equip you to articulate your Concordia experience using a new lens, and help you explain the importance of these experiences to your peers, or as you enter the labour market. 
~~~

After this workshop, students will be able to:
-	Reflect on their experiences (in class, on campus, in their professional experience)
-	Articulate skills gained through their experiential learning
-	Identify opportunities on campus to engage further
-	Express to their peers the value of experiential learning
-	Understand how to have their non-course learning recognized on the Co-Curricular Record

*KEYB*
This workshop has reached capacity. If you are interested in participating in our next drone videography workshop, please send us an email at cce@concordia.ca.

This workshop is offered in English.

Drone videography has really taken off the past few years, enabling breathtaking footage rarely available in the past. And if you’re like many people, you dream of being behind the controls, piloting your drone into new career horizons. It thrills us, too. Which is why we created this workshop. Led by award-winning videographer Diego Rivera-Kohn, you’ll learn about the laws that regulate drone flight in Canada and the basic operation of the more common consumer drones that don’t require a pilot’s certificate. You’ll also learn foundational themes like shot height, speed, distance and gimbal, and the narrative potential they have. Basic camera techniques will focus on light, composition, movement, depth, and suspense. And finally, you’ll have the chance to apply all that knowledge and skill as you learn how to film landscapes, architecture, and people. Ready to take flight?

La vidéographie par drone est en plein essor depuis quelques années, permettant la captation d’images à couper le souffle qu’il était rarement possible de réaliser dans le passé. Comme beaucoup d’enthousiastes, vous rêvez certainement de prendre les commandes de votre drone – jusqu’à en faire une nouvelle carrière! Voilà une perspective très emballante en effet. Et c’est ce qui nous a incités à offrir cet atelier. Sous l’encadrement du vidéographe primé Diego Rivera Kohn, vous vous initierez aux lois qui régissent l’utilisation d’un drone au Canada de même qu’au fonctionnement de base des drones grand public les plus courants dont le pilotage n’exige pas de certificat de pilote. Vous explorerez des thèmes fondamentaux comme l’altitude de prise de vue, la vitesse et la suspension à cardan ainsi que leur potentiel sur le plan narratif. L’apprentissage des techniques de caméra fondamentales sera axé sur la lumière, la composition, le mouvement, la profondeur et la tension dramatique. Enfin, vous aurez l’occasion d’appliquer toutes ces nouvelles connaissances et habiletés en apprenant à filmer des paysages, des œuvres architecturales et des gens. Attention, décollage!

<b>Diego Rivera Kohn</b><br>
With an MFA (Film Production) from Concordia University, Diego is also the Coordinator of the university’s Digital Animation program. While oxygen, food, water, and love sustain him, it is the act of creating that makes him feel most fully human. And that creativity most often finds expression in the act of visual storytelling. In addition to his drone skills, Diego designs and produces motion images for cinema and for multimedia. His films have screened at prominent festivals in Europe, Asia, and North and South America. One of his most recent films, Ex-voto for Three Souls, won a Golden Frog Award at the Plus Camerimage Festival (2008), the world’s premiere film festival dedicated to the art of cinematography. A drone pilot licensed by Transport Canada, Diego is thrilled to be leading this workshop to help train the next generation of drone videographers.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Students do not need any prior knowledge of coding or Python to participate in this workshop. If you are already familiar with coding or Python, then this workshop will be too basic for you and you should not attend.
2. You will receive an email prior to the workshop with instructions for installing Python on your personal computer.
3. Learning to code must be hands-on. Through a series of in-class and online exercises, we will learn to create and troubleshoot (debug) computer programs. Your commitment and participation during class (6 hours) is mandatory. To better manage this process, you will be enrolled in a Moodle course where you will have access to resources and activities. Failure to meet the attendance requirement will result in a grade of Did Not Attend (DNA).

After this workshop, you will be able to:
- Describe the process of creation of computer programs
- Create and execute Python scripts on your computer
- Apply basic elements of the Python programming language (control, selection and repetition statements, variables of simple data types, input/output, and functions) to solve problems or automate tasks
- Apply at least two strategies to troubleshoot (or debug) Python scripts

"http://focu.io/data#course_GPDI_552","Build Your ePortfolio with Beginner Wordpress","12.0","GPDI","552","What is an ePortfolio?

Your ePortfolio is a personal website that holds in one place your academic and professional work.

Is ePortfolio different from CV? 

Absolutely! A CV ‘lists’ your achievements, while ePortfolio ‘shows’ your audience details of what you’ve done in an aesthetically pleasing way. Eportfolios are more memorable than text because you add photos and multimedia to show your work.

Why should I have an ePortfolio?

- Eportfolios are becoming popular to complement traditional CVs and cover letters, and they allow you to:
- Show off to future employers a full picture of your achievements and interests that is not possible in a CV. 
- Build your professional digital footprint. Future employers will search your name on the web, and finding your your eportfolio gives them a great first impression;
- Make yourself “discoverable” in web searches by future employers and collaborators by adding keywords to your eportfolio. 

What will I learn during this workshop?

 - You will learn two professional skills simultaneously: 
 - how to build your ePortfolio; 
 - how to use Wordpress.com. 

This is a beginners course so no previous Wordpress knowledge is required. 

The components of your ePortfolio will be completed incrementally every week. By the end of this 4-week course, your basic ePortfolio will have the following pages:
- About
- Contact
- Projects: multimedia works, etc.
- Optional pages:  volunteering work, etc.

During this workshop we will work with multiple channels:
- 4 weeks with four 1.5-hours lectures on Zoom;
- Selected Udemy videos: participants MUST watch Udemy videos on a weekly basis to learn essential content that is not covered in class (6 hrs);
- Moodle site: post weekly assignments, receive feedback & access additional material;
- Individual consultations (optional): weekly office hours.

~~~
In this workshop you will learn to:
- Acquire a domain, design a site map & build a Wordpress website;
- Create an ePortfolio with: bio, contact, and projects;
- Learn to customize a website to your preferences;
- Build your personal branding, and understand audiences;

Reflecting the long-standing and historical importance of performance practices in the visual arts, students focus on the production of projects that may reflect such issues as real-time, site-specific, interventionist actions, the interrelationship between installations and performances, and the interdisciplinary interface between performance and other practices found in the performing arts. This course also examines video performance and photography as media for generating performative gestures and as documentation tools.","UGRD"

For instance, do you know under what circumstances does an RRSP or a TFSA contribution make more sense? What are some of the most tax-efficient investments available? This webinar briefly reviews Canadian income tax basics while highlighting how the different tax brackets impact various investments and sources of income. We will also review different investment vehicles in greater detail, how they get taxed, and the most tax-efficient way to distribute various investments in different types of accounts. Lastly, we will go over how to properly track and report dividend distributions from a margin account for tax purposes.

Do you want to move your writing from functional closer to the level and style of a native speaker?

English Grammar 1 is the first in a set of two grammar workshops targeted toward non-native English-speaking graduate students at Concordia University. This workshop gives participants a solid foundation needed to move toward producing polished papers, reports, and theses at an advanced level. English Grammar 1 helps remedy some of the most persistent grammar problems that advanced learners of English face – namely, those related to subject-verb agreement, articles, choosing the right verb tense and the use of passive voice – and it supports students who want to become better writers.
~~~ 
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1.	Identify and solve some of the most common grammar problems non-native English-speaking graduate students face such as subject-verb agreement, articles, verb tense and passive voice.
2.	Recognize and correct these grammar problems when they appear in texts.
3.	Apply grammar-related specificities of English academic writing style in own writing.

This workshop is led by Javier Ibarra-Isassi. Javier is a PhD candidate in Biology and his research is focused on answering the questions where organisms are in the world and why they are there. He has a soft spot for ants, so he chose these little creatures as the model system of his research. Before coming to Montreal, he completed his BSc in El Salvador and his MSc in Brazil. Javier has experience in publishing and peer-reviewing academic articles and presenting his research in international conferences. When not doing research, Javier is teaching, reading, or honing his cooking skills.","PDEV"

It traces the historical and intellectual roots of CED/SSE in relation to the praxis of community organizing and local and regional development on Turtle Island. Students apply intersectional and political-economic analysis to identify the potential
and the limitations of local, community-based development strategies. Special importance is given to CED/SSE innovations arising out of feminist, anti-racist and anti-colonial movements for social and environmental justice.

Ce cours donne un aperçu du DÉC et de l’économie sociale et solidaire (ESS), les plaçant dans leur contexte politico-économique. L’accent est mis sur la résilience et l'adaptation collectives face aux risques systémiques touchant la société, tels que ceux posés par les crises climatiques, écosystémiques et de biodiversité. On retrace par ailleurs l’historique et les fondements intellectuels du DÉC et de l’ESS en lien avec la pratique de l’organisation communautaire et du développement local et régional sur l’île de la Tortue. Les étudiant·e·s appliquent l’analyse intersectionnelle et politico-économique pour déterminer le potentiel et les limites des stratégies de développement axées sur les communautés locales. Une attention particulière est portée aux innovations en DÉC/ESS engendrées par les mouvements féministes, antiracistes et anticoloniaux de justice sociale et environnementale.","GRAD"

In this workshop, we strive to improve research proposals for potential and current Master’s students at Concordia University – applying for the Canada Graduate Scholarship Master’s program on Dec 1, 2021. 

This workshop will help students to improve their draft research proposals for scholarship applications. In this class, we will focus on applications to the Canada Graduate Scholarship Master’s program due on Dec 1, 2021. A brief overview of general strategies and tips regarding the research proposals, will be followed by breakout groups where students will discuss and brainstorm their draft proposals.

In addition to having an outline of their own proposed research prepared before class, students will also be entrusted with the chance to discuss the work of others.  Some of this will be done within the workshop setting, while some amount of “homework” will likely be exchanged by email in the days following this meeting. This exchange between students is expected to provide both written and/or verbal feedback (peer-review) on statements from other students in the class, in a respectful and constructive way.

***Notes: Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out on by the Canada Graduate Scholarship – Master’s award. Peer-review can be an excellent source of constructive criticism, but it is also the responsibility of the individual author to decide which feedback to use.***

~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be have gained:
1.	Common strategies when drafting a competitive research proposal;
2.	How to provide and receive courteous and constructive peer-review;
3.	A small group of least 2-3 other students, with whom peer-review can be exchanged.
a.	It is important to realize that you will not only receive feedback on your own draft, but also be expected to provide feedback on the work of others.

"http://focu.io/data#course_GPWL_978","Time Management","6.0","GPWL","978","We all want to make the most of our lives. We want to learn time management skills to work more effectively and efficiently. We want to be able to make time for what truly matters to us. But how?

As a leader in time management research, Brad Aeon has developed a 4-part workshop that will help you manage your time more meaningfully.

Based on over a decade of scientific research, his workshops have helped hundreds of people worldwide increase their personal productivity, health, happiness, and well-being. The four parts are:

1. Purpose. The first step in improving your time management skills is to determine what you really want out of life. You can't effectively manage time if you don't know how you want to spend it. After all, we all manage time for something. This session will help you figure out what that something is. Drawing on the latest research on purpose, meaning in life, motivation, and goal setting, this session will help you find a sense of purpose that inspires and energizes you.

2. Structure. Schedules, calendars, and to-do lists are all tools you can use to gain control of your time. But few people use these tools properly. We think we know how to use them, but in reality they are often more of a hindrance than a help. This session will teach you how to use time management tools effectively, so you can turn them into powerful allies rather than stubborn enemies.

3. Information. Social media, emails, texts, and other digital tools are the most obvious time wasters in our lives. They all compete for your attention. And whatever captures your attention also captures your time. If you want to have more time in the 21st century, you have to learn how to manage the information you receive. This session will teach you techniques to filter, organize, and sort information effectively, so that it works for you rather than against you.

4. Priorities. Most of us have more things that we want to do than time in which to do them. The only way out of this situation is to learn how to prioritize. This session will teach you how to take a step back, assess your life, and determine your most important goals, so you can focus your precious time on the things that really matter.

~~~
This workshop will help students improve their time management skills.
~~~

This workshop is led by Brad Aeon. Brad Aeon is obsessed with how people think about and use time. He did his PhD on the history, sociology, and psychology of time management. His TED Talk The Philosophy of Time Management invites people to reconsider their relationship with time from a fundamental and existential perspective. Brad’s research and ideas have been featured in top media outlets, including the Harvard Business Review, BBC News, and CBC. He has worked with numerous companies and nonprofits to help people feel more in control of their time using evidence-based, innovative strategies. Brad Aeon is also the founder and director of the Time Research Institute, a registered nonprofit dedicated to making time management accessible to vulnerable and underprivileged populations.","PDEV"

*KEYB*
Artificial Intelligence (AI) doesn’t exist without data. In 2006, British mathematician Clive Humby said, “Data is the new oil.” And data is the fuel that powers AI. However, having data is not enough, you need good data. But how can you identify quality data in the AI world? This course provides the answer. 

The first part of the course will help you identify good data, spot potential biases, and interpret graphs and other visualizations from data. The second part of the course will focus on the practical aspects of data for AI projects. This section will help you assess data requirements for AI projects, differentiate between various storage methods, and identify data sources. Upon completion of the course, you will grasp the single most important aspect of AI—data.

To help you develop data skills for AI, you will be exposed to case studies and other projects that resemble data-related situations AI professionals face daily. During these exercises, you will examine the different steps of the data lifecycle to help you assess data quality and the requirements for various AI projects. The assignments will position you as the domain expert and client on an AI project and teach you how to work alongside a data scientist. Are you up for the challenge? 

This is an online, synchronous course.

We recommend taking the AI Foundations (CEAI 1001) and Responsible AI (CEAI 1002) before taking this course.
*CNT*
This course is a great way to help you:
•	Explain the importance of ""good"" data in AI projects
•	Describe the different types of data used in AI projects
•	Identify the different techniques used to handle and store data in AI
•	Assess what is required to carry out an AI project
*APP*
This fully online course employs a project-based approach that focuses on the acquisition of practical real-world skills in AI. You will learn directly from industry professionals and receive individualized feedback. You will have the opportunity to go beyond AI theory by actively participating in assignments aimed at using AI for problem-solving.
*WHO*
•	Tech enthusiasts who want to add AI to their skill set
•	Leaders with financial, operational, or technological responsibilities who are interested in adopting AI
•	Managers who want to better support their technical AI employees or who may be involved in AI projects
•	Employees in different industries who want to learn how AI solutions can help solve problems or want to contribute to their organization’s AI initiatives more meaningfully

Adopting the strategies for creating cohesive ideas, impactful statements, and a logical flow is crucial to any academic writing career.
Applicable to graduate-level writers of all backgrounds, the Perfecting the Paragraph workshop aims to provide participants with an understanding of the most common mistakes that lead to unconvincing, unclear writing. Taking the paragraph as an “idea” unit, the workshop looks at the formulation and purpose of the topic sentence. It then focuses on paragraph structure, development of the main idea, transition to the next paragraph, punctuation, style, and vocabulary.

***This workshop is particularly useful for non-native English speakers. Please note that this workshop focuses on basic elements and tips important for academic paragraph writing.***

This workshop is divided in three segments. The first segment will present the basic elements of an academic paragraph. The second segment will overview useful tips and resources to keep in mind while writing. In the third segment, participants will review a writing sample as part of a peer-reviewing exercise. In a supportive environment, the instructor and participants will provide feedback on randomly assigned, anonymous writing samples based on the information presented in the previous two segments.  Since writing samples are anonymous, participants are highly encouraged to submit their own writing samples to be peer-reviewed during this segment.
~~~
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1.	Articulate the elements of the academic paragraph
2.	Review tips and resources for paragraph composition
3.	Evaluate example paragraphs for their composition

Research proposals vary tremendously between departments, research areas, and individuals, but there are also standard ways to present this material for each agency and scholarship program. Most fundamentally, this requires that all applicants read the program instructions carefully for the drafts they are creating.  For example, several programs require clear 1) background/introduction, 2) hypothesis/aims/objectives, 3) method/description, 4) Implications/Impact. This can often mean creating sub-headings within your proposal to explicitly identify and address each of these elements.

Note: Students are still ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they ultimately select. 
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: 
•	Identify the key elements that are required within a research proposal, for a certain funding program under SSHRC/FRQSC.
•	Format your proposal in such a way to highlight each of these essential items.
•	Draft a preliminary research proposal and send it out for appropriate peer-review and feedback.

Positive impact. Positive returns.

The world of investing is seeing a seismic, generational shift. A new breed of investor has emerged – one who’s looking to generate returns that go beyond financial gain.

Sustainable investing, impact investing - however you define it – is investing that takes environmental and social considerations into account, as well as financial goals.

"http://focu.io/data#course_GPDI_515","Data Science & Communication with R","6.0","GPDI","515","Do you have data you'd like to analyze? Would you like to gain insights from your data and communicate them with eye-catching visualizations and reports? Are you tired of being chained to Excel or expensive proprietary software?  If the answer to any of these questions is ""Yes!"", then this workshop is for you. R is an open source and versatile programming language that's perfect for data analysis, visualization, and science communication.
 
In this all-in-one course, you'll learn the basics of programming and be introduced to the RStudio interface. We'll then move on to how to import and clean data, how to make publication quality plots and visualizations, and how to generate scientific reports to communicate your findings; all within the R ecosystem!
 
In this three-part interactive workshop, you'll learn to:
•         Import CSV and Excel files
•         Install and use external packages
•         Clean and explore data
•         Generate descriptive statistics
•         Create and customize plots
•         Write custom functions
 
All of this is done with principles of reproducibility in mind, so you can write code that is clear and easily shareable with others. No previous coding experience is necessary. R is used in fields ranging from linguistics and marketing to ecology and sports analytics and many more. If you want the ability to get more out of your data, join us to get started using R.  
 
***IMPORTANT NOTES
1.      This workshop is replacing ""Beginners Guide to R"" and ""Reproducible Scientific Analysis with R"" from previous semesters as an all-in-one resource for R programming. Those who have taken one of these workshops in the past will find some of the content repetitive. 
2.      This is a hands-on workshop requiring R and RStudio. Participants require their own computer to complete mandatory activities.  Registered participants will receive R and RStudio installation instructions by email a couple days prior to the first meeting.***  
 ~~~
In this workshop, participants will:
 
1. Discover the terminology of basic coding, such as working directory, script, library, function, csv, concatenation, data frame, etc.;
2. Learn about coding and the types of resources available while coding;
3. Install different R packages;
4. Use vectors and data frames to store and manipulate data;
5. Create projects in R;
6. Familiarize themselves with R and RStudio capabilities that they can apply to their own research

"http://focu.io/data#course_GPLL_12","From Scholarly Research to Crafting an Op-Ed","2.0","GPLL","12","Although academic journals and other scholarly outlets are valuable, their impact outside of academia is questionable as scholarly publications often sit in digital repositories where they are rarely read by non-academics.

Given that graduate students investigate some of the most pressing issues in society, we must find ways to ensure that our work reaches the broader public. One way of doing this is to engage in op-ed writing. 

Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.

In this 2-hour workshop we outline the key elements and strategies that contribute to writing powerful op-eds that journal editors will want to publish. First, we present the theory behind writing op-eds, including: what is an op-ed, what are news cycles, and how do the two fit together; the benefits of writing an op-ed; and analyze the components, structure, and style of an op-ed. During the second half of the session, participants will practice writing a news ‘lede’ and ‘hook’ (e.g., the key introductory components of an op-ed) that is relevant to their research field. 
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to:

1.	Understand the importance of writing op-eds as a grad student;
2.	Identify when and how to join a news conversation;
3.	Identify the key components of an op-ed and understand their functions;
4.	Understand and evaluate journalistic writing styles;
5.	Write an impactful news ‘lede’ and ‘hook’;

He is the editor-in-chief of Ecological Monograph and has published 50 scientific peer-reviewed articles in a variety of outlets: from specialized entomological journals to top tier ecology and evolution journals.

Dr. Caroline Roux is an Associate Professor of Marketing and holds the Concordia University Research Chair in Psychology of Resource Scarcity. Her primary area of research explores how reminders of resource scarcity affect consumers’ cognitions, judgment, and behaviour. More broadly, her research interests focus on better understanding how pro-social values and moral considerations influence consumers’ decision making.

Ketra Schmitt is an Associate Professor in the Centre for Engineering in Society at Concordia University who studies policy issues with significant scientific, social and ethical uncertainty. She received her PhD in Engineering and Public Policy and Master’s in Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University and her Bachelor’s in Environmental Sciences and Policy from Duke University.

diverse audiences and to interrogate the impact of dance practices on
the environment, dancers’ bodies, and communities. Students study the
work of choreographers who practice social, decolonized, and
environmental sustainability and examine ways to apply these
approaches to their own creative practices.

Writing strategies and tips can often be applied globally, so this workshop aims to offer ways that graduate students can develop and improve their scholarship applications. For example, this workshop will offer writing tips to aid in the development of many standard and essential sections of the application (e.g. outline of proposed research, and other applicant statements). Funding agencies typically expect students to be the author of their own applications, but this does not mean writing in isolation – and does not exclude the important contributions and feedback of peers, research supervisors and other mentors.  

Note: Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out on by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they select.
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: 
•	Identify peers to provide essential feedback on sections of the application, as well as the application as a whole.
•	Consider ways to benchmark against materials from previous scholarship winners.
•	Adapt their writing and presentation styles to present achievements in succinct and effective ways.
~~~
This workshop is led by Michael Verwey, the Fellowship Development Advisor in the School of Graduate Studies at Concordia University. After completing his doctorate in the Department of Psychology at Concordia University, Michael was a postdoctoral researcher at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute and the Montreal Clinical Research Institute.

This diversity is expressed in terms of the students’ ages, cultural background, language, disability condition, socio-economic status, and other non-traditional profiles. The heterogeneity of this inclusive classroom and our new online reality brings with it the challenge to design courses that meet the objectives of the course or program while effectively responding to the needs of all learners. In order to meet these challenges, innovative approaches like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) are being implemented. Designing our courses using these strategies and techniques makes them more accessible to everyone, thus reducing the need for individual accommodations.
~~~
By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
• Describe  the three principles of universal design for Learning (UDL)
• Identify effective teaching strategies and approaches for each principle

~~~
This workshop will be led by Anna Barrafato.

*KEYB*
Poor accounting skills can lead to heavy losses and far, far worse. In this course, the numbers add up to a distinct gain for you, no matter what type of business you might go into. You'll learn the fundamentals of basic accounting principles and statements, and you'll better understand the role of accounting information as it relates to decision-making (we could all use that!). You'll gain competency in journal-entry processing and in the preparation and interpretation of income statements, balance sheets and more. And that can only help your bottom line.
*CNT*
This course is a great way to help you:
•	Analyze business transactions;
•	Record financial transactions using journal entries;
•	Prepare adjusting and closing entries;
•	Prepare financial statements and bank reconciliations.
*APP*
As in the workplace, teamwork is key here. Sure, there will be engaging assignments and activities, but you'll also form ad-hoc teams to discuss real-world subjects presented by business experts. You'll formulate strategies to solve problems or seize opportunities. Above all, you'll have ample chance to contribute personally to the process. This course is designed with a combination of online live synchronous learning where the instructor and the students meet in a virtual classroom (Zoom) at the same time, and asynchronous work guided by the instructor and completed by students in their own time.  
*WHO*
•	Students who want an introduction to the fundamentals of business accounting.
•	Students who want to pursue an accounting education or a career in any type of business.
•	Budding entrepreneurs who want to get off on the right foot.
•	Foreign business students who want to understand the principles of business accounting in Canada.","CCCE"
